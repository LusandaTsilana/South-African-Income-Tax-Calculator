# South-African-Income-Tax-Calculator

The South African Revenue Service is losing income year in year out because people do not how much they are supposed to pay in taxes in relation to their annual income. 
I developed a tax calculator system to be used by people to calculate their tax obligations using their 
annual incomes.

The individual tax information is available from SARS. You can get the information on the following url:

This calculator is based on 2023/2024 financial year
